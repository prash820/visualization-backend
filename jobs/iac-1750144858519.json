  "prompt": "MealMuse is an intelligent meal planning app that uses AI to generate personalized recipes and weekly plans based on your taste preferences, dietary restrictions, and available ingredients. Whether you're vegan, keto, diabetic, or just trying to eat healthier, MealMuse adapts to your lifestyle in seconds. \n\nUsers begin by selecting their dietary goals, favorite cuisines, disliked ingredients, and how much time they usually have to cook. From there, MealMuse creates a tailored weekly menu, complete with easy-to-follow recipes, portion guidance, and a smart shopping list. The app also supports pantry syncing — input what’s in your kitchen, and it recommends dishes you can cook right now.\n\nIntegrated calorie and macro tracking makes it a helpful tool for fitness and health goals. Plus, MealMuse learns with each use — the more you cook and rate meals, the better it gets at predicting what you'll love.\n\nAdditional features include integration with grocery delivery services, voice-guided cooking mode, and options for batch cooking or single servings.\n\nMealMuse is not just a recipe app — it’s your AI-powered kitchen companion designed to save time, reduce food waste, and make healthy eating intuitive, personalized, and enjoyable.
